        <p>Clash of Clans is a freemium mobile strategy video game developed and published by Finnish game developer Supercell. The game was released for iOS platforms on August 2, 2012, and on Google Play for Android on October 7, 2013.

            The game is set in a fantasy-themed[3] persistent world[4] where the player is a chief of a village. Clash of Clans tasks players to build their own village using the resources gained from attacking other players through the game's fighting features, and producing them themselves. The main resources are gold, elixir and dark elixir. Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of up to fifty people who can then participate in Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other.
            
            Clash of Clans was released to generally positive reviews from critics.
